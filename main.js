Because it is typically more expensive than ordering a bulk amount. So rounding up to a higher quantity saves you money!!\r\n12 (minimum) = $79\r\n25 koozies = $88\r\n30 koozies = $100\r\n50 koozies = $108\r\n75 koozies = $140 (yes it costs more because of bulk discounts!)\r\n100 koozies = $134\r\n125 koozies = $144\r\n150 koozies = $176 (yes it costs more because of bulk discounts!)\r\n175 koozies = $180\r\n200 koozies = $158\r\n225 koozies = $180\r\n250 koozies = $188\r\n300 koozies = $218\r\n350 koozies = $238\r\n400 koozies = $262\r\n500 koozies = $326\r\n\r\nQ: Can I do fewer than 12 koozies?\r\n--\r\nA: I&#39;m afraid 12 is the minimum my printer will run, so yay for extras!\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: Can I do more than one color of koozie per order?\r\n--\r\nA: Yes, if you order at least 25, you can order 2 koozie colors. For orders over 50, you can select up to 4 koozie colors.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: Do you have other colors available than what is shown in the swatches?\r\n--\r\nA: Not at this time.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: Can I mix and match phrases? For example, doing half &quot;Love Laughter&quot; and half the order &quot;Have & Hold&quot;?\r\n--\r\nA: No. We can only do one set of artwork per order. If you would like more than one phrase, we can do two separate orders at a slight discount. Please contact me for details.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ; Why I haven&#39;t I received a proof yet?\r\n--\r\nA: I have a full time job. And do Etsy nights and weekends. Typically I can get a proof to you within 48 hours, but if you have not heard from me, please be patient. \r\n\r\n\r\nQ; How many revisions can I get?\r\n--\r\nA: Prior to ordering I am happy to provide 3 complimentary proofs. Any additional edits are charged at $20 per round. However, if you actually purchase an item, I am happy to work with you until the proof is correct. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

Because it is typically more expensive than ordering a bulk amount. So rounding up to a higher quantity saves you money!!\r\n12 (minimum) = $79\r\n25 koozies = $88\r\n30 koozies = $100\r\n50 koozies = $108\r\n75 koozies = $140 (yes it costs more because of bulk discounts!)\r\n100 koozies = $134\r\n125 koozies = $144\r\n150 koozies = $176 (yes it costs more because of bulk discounts!)\r\n175 koozies = $180\r\n200 koozies = $158\r\n225 koozies = $180\r\n250 koozies = $188\r\n300 koozies = $218\r\n350 koozies = $238\r\n400 koozies = $262\r\n500 koozies = $326\r\n\r\nQ: Can I do fewer than 12 koozies?\r\n--\r\nA: I&#39;m afraid 12 is the minimum my printer will run, so yay for extras!\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: Can I do more than one color of koozie per order?\r\n--\r\nA: Yes, if you order at least 25, you can order 2 koozie colors. For orders over 50, you can select up to 4 koozie colors.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: Do you have other colors available than what is shown in the swatches?\r\n--\r\nA: Not at this time.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: Can I mix and match phrases? For example, doing half &quot;Love Laughter&quot; and half the order &quot;Have & Hold&quot;?\r\n--\r\nA: No. We can only do one set of artwork per order. If you would like more than one phrase, we can do two separate orders at a slight discount. Please contact me for details.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ; Why I haven&#39;t I received a proof yet?\r\n--\r\nA: I have a full time job. And do Etsy nights and weekends. Typically I can get a proof to you within 48 hours, but if you have not heard from me, please be patient. \r\n\r\n\r\nQ; How many revisions can I get?\r\n--\r\nA: Prior to ordering I am happy to provide 3 complimentary proofs. Any additional edits are charged at $20 per round. However, if you actually purchase an item, I am happy to work with you until the proof is correct. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

            "description": "This rainbow coffee cup cozy is a perfect fit for the average disposable paper coffee cup. It will keep your hot drink hot and prevent fingers from getting too toasty! Pictured here on a 16oz cup, but it will also fit a can, or pint glass. Cozies even help prevent condensation puddles when used on cold items.\r\n\r\nAll cozies are handmade in Portland, Oregon in a pet and smoke free home from soft acrylic and cotton yarn.\r\n\r\nBecause each cozy is handmade, there may be slight variations from the original one pictured, but I take great care to make sure you will hardly notice.\r\n\r\nConvo me if you are in need of priority shipping. Or if you have questions. Or if you just want to say hi! Or perhaps you are interested in this cozy styled for a mug... An example may be seen here: http://www.etsy.com/listing/75894964/aqua-mug-cozy-with-red-button?ref=pr_shop\r\n\r\nCare instructions:\r\nHandwash gently with mild soap. Don&#39;t twist! Rinse well and press flat between a towel before laying flat to dry.\r\n\r\nHere is a quick way to return to my shop: http://www.etsy.com/shop/thecozyproject",

            "description": "For the ultimate IRON MAIDEN fan. Brewed by the Robinson Cheshire Family Breweries, under the supervision of Bruce Dickinson, these bottles are a MUST HAVE for fans. Using the image of Eddie in his &quot;Trooper uniform, inspired by The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot;, in the Battle of Bacalava during the Crimean War. \r\nYou are purchasing the crate that has been hand crafted to hold the bottle, for display.  The bottle has been drained of beer and washed clean. BOTTLE CONTAINS NO BEER!\r\nDimensions of the crate measure  10-3/4&quot; tall, with a base that is 3-3/4&quot; by 3-3/4&quot;.\r\n\r\nAs this is a highly breakable product, it will be packaged in such a way to prevent damage. This causes a little extra on the shipping cost. But for about $25.00, you can have this collectible in your home on display in about a week&#39;s time.\r\n\r\nPlease check out our shop and shipping policies.\r\n\r\nThanks for stopping by.",

I aim to have all USA topper sets shipped out a least a week before the wedding so that they arrive approx 4 or 5 days before the wedding date, (with the exception of rush orders and international orders, please see shop policies for more info on rush and/or international orders).  If you need your toppers earlier than that, then please convo me asap to see if this is possible, it may incur a rush fee, and/or a shipping up-grade which I can invoice you for via paypal if needed/ wanted.\r\n\r\n♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ \r\n\r\n          FOR  DESTINATION WEDDINGS - CUSTOM DOLL CAKE TOPPERS\r\n          ________________________________________________\r\n\r\nFOR WOODEN DOLL WEDDING TOPPERS - If you have a DESTINATION WEDDING and need your toppers by your destination date and not your wedding date, than this also must be agreed upon before purchase. During busy times or busy seasons I may switch to processing orders by wedding date regardless of the time frame quoted for creation previously given, however I will stick with my shipping policies for sending a week before your wedding date, (for USA orders)  I do not accept orders I cannot finish and ship in time. I will have your order shipped in time, but the delivery of your order is at the mercy of USPS, who are usually fairly safe and accurate, but please note any postal delays due to weather/ storms/ or postal delays or mis-management or postal errors that may delay your package are out of my hands.  I am at the mercy of any postal system errors that may take place the same as you are.   International orders are completely at the mercy of International customs so I do not guarantee International orders by a certain date, I do however ship within the USPS guidelines for International shipping. Please see shop policies for full disclosure on international shipping. \r\n\r\n♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ \r\n\r\n                   THE ADDRESS ON YOUR ETSY INVOICE\r\n                   _________________________________\r\n        \r\nADDRESS: Please make sure the address as stated on your Etsy invoice is correct as this is the address that I will ship too.  It is the customers responsibility to ensure the correct address is stated, shipping issues resulting in an incorrect address is not the fault or responsibility of the seller, I can only ship to the address that I am given, please ensure that it is correct, thank you kindly.  If you need to change your shipping address this needs to be approved my me first.   Please convo me asap if you need to change your address, last minute convos in an attempt to change your address may be missed or it may be too late, last minute address changes may not be accepted (or missed) due to this reason - once a package has shipped it has shipped, if you have failed to let me know your shipping address change I cannot be held responsible for this error, once again I can only ship to the address I am provided.\r\n\r\nSHIPPING ADDRESS MUST BE STATED IN ENGLISH ONLY - for example I cannot ship to an address stated in Japanese characters - the USPS will not accept this - The shipping address must be IN ENGLISH ONLY - please convo me asap to let me know your address in English if another language is stated on your Etsy invoice.\r\n\r\n♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ \r\n\r\n                      SKIN TONE - FOR PEG DOLL ORDERS\r\n                     _______________________________\r\n\r\nA NOTE REGARDING SKIN TONE FOR WEDDING TOPPERS:   for custom wedding toppers and peg doll orders- most of the doll sets shown in my shop have natural wood faces with just sealer, this works well for most peoples skin tones, for example White, Asian, light skinned Hispanic, Middle Eastern etc.  I usually only &#39;paint&#39; the faces upon request for either much darker skin tones or much lighter skin tones, for example, a very pale (pinkish white) couple such as Irish, may request a painted face for a pink/ white complexion, or for example, an African American couple will most likely request a painted face from anywhere from a light brown/ bronze tone, to a dark brown tone (examples can be seen in my shop listings)  \r\nPlease note that all dolls will be created with natural wood faces unless otherwise requested for a &#39;painted&#39; face for a lighter or darker skin tone.  For example if both bride and groom is white (or another race), and the bride states that she is pale, and the groom states that he is white but has a &#39;tan&#39;, or it is just stated as tan skin regardless or race, then both bride and groom will come the same with natural wood faces with sealer, unless you specifically request that the bride or groom be painted a &#39;tan&#39; color, or brown color, or dark brown color etc, and an example is sent of what exact tone of &#39;tan&#39; or brown etc you would like, otherwise natural wood faces will be used for both bride and groom regardless or race.  If you would like a skin tone other than the natural wood please let me know and what shade of tan or brown you would like the doll painted, please also send examples, otherwise it will be natural wood faces for both/ all dolls regardless of race.  Please also note that I may interpret  the color of the tan or brown skin to be lighter or darker than your wishes as this can be hard to tell from a photo, please bare this in mind when ordering, if you are particularly picking about this then I would recommend not ordering a &#39;painted&#39; skin tone.  I cannot accept returns on custom orders if you feel the skin tone color is not quite right,  as I cannot see you in person I can only go with my interpretation of the photo, please understand this, thank you kindly.\r\n\r\n♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ \r\n\r\n                                     SHIPMENT  - HOW I SHIP\r\n                                     ___________________\r\n\r\nAll orders are sent via USPS.  You will be sent another conformation message when your order ships.  All USA topper sets will be sent with tracking in the form of either Delivery Confirmation, or Signature Confirmation at my discretion.  Sorry tracking is not available for International customers as the USPS does not offer this service for international orders with first class mail, therefore I cannot offer it to my international customers since I am using there service.  An international packages is assigned a  CN-22 Customs Declaration number (which is proof of shipping,)  but does NOT track the package on it&#39;s journey.  I CANNOT track and international package in transit please bare this in mind please PRIOR to purchase, thank you.\r\n\r\n♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ \r\n\r\n\r\n              INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS - PLEASE READ\r\n             _______________________________________\r\n\r\nPlease make sure to read about International Shipping and the time frame that it takes, and about International customs.  International orders are not guaranteed by a certain delivery date, as this is impossible due to international customs, but every effort will be made to have wedding toppers make it in time, for wedding toppers I ship all International orders within the USPS guidelines for International shipping. Please see shop policies for full disclosure on international shipping.   \r\n\r\nProps and banners are made to order, the creation timeframe is as stated in the listing information, your scheduled ship date will be stated on your Etsy invoice (top right by the address.)  Your order will be shipped on or before this date.  When ordering props and/or banners please make sure to leave enough time for creation of the item plus shipping to your location.  Most international packages arrive in an approx 2 to 4 week timeframe, but it is possible for custom delays to occur.  Some countries take much longer for packages to arrive, these known countries are as stated on my shop policies page, (other countries not listed may also possibly be included in this list,)  in the case of these countries (or custom delays for all countries) then it is possible that shipping may even take a month or two, for up to a max of 3 months if custom delays arise.   I advise all international customers to order props and banners approx 2.5 to 3 months ahead of the date you need to receive them by for a timely delivery (not including creation time for the item.)\r\n\r\nThere is NO TRACKING for international orders - I ship with USPS first class air mail the USPS does not offer tracking numbers with this service so therefore I cannot offer this to my international customers, (so I cannot track an international packages on it&#39;s journey.)  An international package is assigned a Customs Declaration number which is proof of shipping, but does NOT track the package on it&#39;s journey at all, please bare this in mind when you order - Patience is needed if an international package is delayed or stuck in customs, if you do not have the time to wait for an international package to arrive then I advise you to please not order from this shop,  I have outlined very clearly how international shipping works and the timeframe that this may take, I have no control over international shipping, custom officials, and the timeframe that this may take.  Custom delays are a part of international shipping, if this upsets you then it is best not to order as delays may occur, this could mean that your package could possibly miss the day that you want/ need the item by, please understand that I cannot guarantee the arrival date of an international package, so if you cannot wait for the package to arrive or do not order in time (as stated above,) please do not order here as I have no way to track it, thank you kindly for understanding.\r\n\r\nIMPORT DUTY TAXES - Also pleased be advised that your country may also assess import duty/taxes to your items you have purchased, (your package,)  this is the buyers responsibility to pay any taxes or duty fees associated with the package.   This is not a shipping charge, it is an import tax imposed by your country that you may have to pay to your country depending on the rules and regulations of your country, and the total purchase price of your package,  (I cannot mark a package as a gift as this is illegal, so please do not ask me.)   You must pay this import tax fee if your country applies this fee to your package if you wish to receive your package.   Seller will NOT pay import taxes for the customer,  as this in NOT a shipping charge, this is the buyers responsibility to pay any taxes that are applied by your county.    Please check with your local customs before placing an order if you do not wish to pay import or duty taxes to see if they apply for what you are ordering by your country.   Returns and refunds will not be accepted due to a customer who refuses to pay import taxes  if your country decides to apply taxes to your package.  You can read all about International shipping and customs here: http://www.etsy.com/shop/CreativeButterflyXOX/policy\r\n\r\n♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ \r\n\r\nPlease refer to my shop policies page regarding refunds and cancellations here: http://www.etsy.com/shop/CreativeButterflyXOX/policy?ref=shopinfo_policies_leftnav - There are no refunds on custom orders, semi custom orders or personalized orders.

If you have purchased some other type of personalized or custom order such as props/ banner/ sign/ ornament etc, and any and all other non custom orders, then If you wish to cancel please let me know within 48 hours after placing the order of you wish to cancel (via Etsy convo only please.)   If your order has already shipped, (or if it has shipped early, or has already been created and is due to ship,) then it has shipped and/or is ready to be shipped and cannot be cancelled once it has shipped. A cancellation fee or restocking fee of $3.00 will be charged per item for cancelled orders. For a multiple item purchase (more than 1 item) then the cancellation fee will not exceed $5.00 - and/or a 15% restocking or cancellation fee for high price items or large orders at my discretion.

HOW DO I SEND YOU MY DETAILS FOR MY CUSTOM  WOODEN DOLL WEDDING CAKE TOPPER AND PHOTOS?\r\n\r\n** A -  THE CUSTOMIZATION FORM - during purchase all customers are asked to fill out a customization form for wedding cake toppers, this is found in the listing information.  I request that you copy the form from the listing information and then paste that form into the &quot;Note to Seller&quot; at checkout, completed with the answers to the questions of your customization details, as well as providing me with your wedding date (or date needed by if you have a destination wedding.)  \r\nI base the customization of your topper set from this information on the customization form, (I will request photos if I need any later, after I check over your written information on the customization form.)   You can send me photos via Etsy convo, but please do not send any photos until after purchase, I only create a file for a customer after purchase, and then all details I receive go into that file, I will send you a detalied list of what photos I will need and instructions for sending them via Etsy convo, please allow approx 2 to 5 business days for this convo as I do them in batches during the busy wedding season.)  \r\nPlease be advised that I do not take down/ write down/ or save any customization notes until AFTER PURCHASE, if you have sent me any information previously in an Etsy convo (before you actually purchased,) then you must also please include that information on the customization form as asked for during purchase to be placed in the &quot;Note to Seller&quot; at checkout.  If you have sent to me any previous information before you actually purchased your order in an Etsy convo, and have not also included that information on the customization form,  then please note that I DO NOT have a note of that information on file for you.   Once a customer purchases a topper set,  I create a file for the custom and then all information and photos sent by the customer AFTER purchase will be saved to the customers file, the information I will include in the customers file includes the information sent to me on the customization form and any information and photos sent to me via Etsy convo AFTER PURCHASE ONLY, so please make sure you send me any and all relevant information you want included on your topper set to me after purchase, and include all details in your customization form.  \r\n\r\n__________________________________________________\r\n\r\nFOR WOODEN DOLL ORDERS  -  WHAT IS YOUR DATE NEEDED TO RECEIVED BY?\r\n*** THE WEDDING DATE OR DATE NEEDED BY - PLEASE MAKE SURE THIS IS CORRECT ***\r\n\r\n** WEDDING DATE - As most wedding topper orders orders are processed by wedding dates, I will use the wedding date that you provide to me on the customization form as the date to process your order by.  Please make sure that this is your correct wedding date.  It is the responsibility of the customer to provide me with the correct wedding date for all custom wedding cake topper orders, and to include their wedding date on the customization form that should be included in the &quot;Note to Seller&quot; at checkout.  \r\nIf you have a DESTINATION WEDDING, or you need your topper earlier such as for your cake decorator, or just because you want to receive it earlier,  then please make sure to leave me your actual wedding date, and then ALSO provide me with your date needed by or destination date.  Once I have your date needed by, your custom topper will be processed by your date needed by rather than your wedding date.   For USA customers toppers ship aporox a week before wedding date or date needed by, and for international customers they ship approx 4 weeks prior to wedding date or date needed by. \r\n\r\nIMPORTANT INFO FOR DESTINATION WEDDINGS:  If you have a destination wedding, or are needing your wedding toppers before your actual wedding date, then you must provide me with your wedding date as well as your &#39;date needed by&#39; or &#39;destination date&#39; upfront when you first order, even if it is only a short time frame of a few days difference from your actual wedding date, otherwise your order will be processed by your wedding date, not your destination date or date needed by.  Your &#39;date needed by&#39; as well as your wedding date, should be given to me when you fill out your customization form at time of purchase.  Please copy the customization from and paste it into the &quot;note to seller&quot; at checkout and complete will all relevant details.\r\nAll toppers are processed by wedding dates, or date needed by stated, so please make sure I have been provided with this date.    If you have a destination wedding then it is very important to give me your destination date upfront so that I can process your order by your destination date or date needed by, and NOT your wedding date.  If you try to give me a destination date or date needed by later on, I may NOT be able to accommodate your request if I am fully booked out for that time period, so please if you have a destination wedding, please make sure to give me that destination date UPFRONT otherwise I may not be able to accommodate you if you tell me too late, and/or you may have to pay for express shipping or another upgraded shipping service, (USA only) and/or a rush order fee.\r\n______________________________________________\r\n\r\n*** PLEASE MAKE SURE YOUR SHIPPING ADDRESS IS CORRECT ON YOUR ETSY INVOICE FOR ALL ORDERS - AND THAT THE ADDRESS IS IN ENGLISH **\r\n\r\n\r\n★★ I DO NOT SHIP TO GIFT ADDRESS OR ALTERNATIVE ADDRESS - YOUR SHIPPING ADDRESS IS THE ADDRESS AS STATED ON YOUR ETSY INVOICE - THIS ADDRESS SHOULD ALSO BE EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE ADDRESS AS STATED ON YOUR PAYPAL,  IF IT IS NOT PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT YOU UPDATE YOUR PAYPAL AND ETSY SHIPPING ADDRESS PRIOR TO PURCHASE★★\r\n\r\n\r\n** CUSTOMERS ADDRESS:  It is the customers responsibility to provide me with a correct and accurate shipping address.  I use the shipping address as stated on the Etsy account invoice, this should be the same address as stated on your Paypal account also, so please make sure that it is.  It is the customers responsibility to make sure that the address on Paypal and Etsy are both the same and the correct shipping address.  If your Paypal and Etsy address differ from each other, then I hold the right to ship to either or address at my discretion, but I go with the shipping address as stated on your ETSY invoice as my default shipping address.  By purchasing from this shop you agree that you have provided me with your correct shipping address (as stated on your Etsy invoice) and your Etsy and Paypal address match, any error with this address lies at the fault of the customer and NOT the seller, as I can only ship to the address that I am provided.\r\nIf the USPS cannot register your address in the system because you have an incorrect address, then I will contact you via Etsy convo for you to re-check your address and send to me your correct address.  If the USPS cannot register your address because it is incorrect or insufficient then I will not be able to send your order out to you until you respond to my Etsy convo with a correct and accurate address.  If you fail to respond to my convo in a timely manner and this delays the shipping of your order or makes your order arrive late for your event, then this is the responsibility of the buyer, you must make sure I have the correct shipping address upfront.  \r\nIf you need to change your address for any reason (such as you have moved or you need your package sent to a family member etc,)  then I may do this for you depending on the situation (at my discretion,) if you agree that you have removed your right to have it sent to the shipping address that you have on Etsy and/or Paypal accounts/ invoices, and that you agree and approve of the new shipping address that you (the customer) have provided via Etsy convo.  Any change of shipping address must be sent to me asap via Etsy convo and then approved by me, I may request that you change your paypal account to reflect the new shipping address.  If I have already mailed out your package and you failed to send me your address change before hand, then that remains the responsibility of the buyer.  It is too late to give me an address change if  your order has already shipped, or if it is the same week that your order is due to ship, it is too late to try and change your shipping address then.   Bottom line is I must be provided the correct shipping address by the customer and this is the customers responsibility.  If you try to change your shipping address last moment then it may be too late if I did not get to read your convo on time, for this reason please make sure to let me know within 24 hours of any order placed via Etsy convo if you need to change your shipping address.\r\n\r\nTHE SHIPPING ADRESS on your Etsy invoice must be in ENGLISH please.   If you are from another country, for example if you are from Japan and your address is stated in japanese characters on your Etsy invoice - then please leave me a note in the &quot;note to seller&#39; at checkout or an Etsy convo of your address in English please.  I will not be able to ship to an address (for example in Japanese characters) as the USPS will not accept it - so ALL ADDRESS NEED TO BE SENT IN ENGLISH ONLY PLEASE.\r\n__________________________________________________\r\n\r\n** Q.  WHAT DO I DO IF I NEED TO PLACE A RUSH ORDER FOR A CUSTOM WOODEN DOLL WEDDING CAKE TOPPER ?\r\n\r\n*** A.  - If you are in need of a RUSH ORDER  for a custom toppers please convo me PRIOR to purchase with your WEDDING DATE and LOCATION/ COUNTRY to see if it is possible depending on my current work load.  A rush order fee may be applied to your order, this is to cover the rush order work load, and not necessarily for shipping, depending on how soon you need it you may also need to pay for an upgraded shipping method.\r\nFor rush orders for wedding cake toppers I strive to have them delivered 3 days before the wedding, (unless I was given a very short time frame in which case 1 day before the wedding.)  I will ship with USPS first class  mail.  Every effort will be made to ensure your rush order is delivered on time, but cannot be guaranteed unless you would like your rush order sent with &#39;Express overnight mail&#39; which is a guaranteed service from USPS for an additional fee.  Your order will only be sent with &#39;Express overnight mail&#39; if you have paid for this service and it is listed as such on the listing order you purchase.  A &#39;rush order fee&#39; does not cover express overnight mail, that is an additional charge itself, just to clarify.\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________\r\n\r\n** Q.  WHAT DO I DO IF I NEED TO PLACE A RUSH ORDER FOR A PROP OR BANNER ORDER?\r\n\r\n**A. - Props and banners generally take approx 10 business days to create + shipping time to your location, as stated above and in each listing.  If you need an order for props and banners sooner than that please convo me PRIOR to purchase with what you would like to purchase, your date needed by, and your location, to see if I can fit you in for a rush order - A rush fee may apply and/or an upgraded shipping menthod may be needed (for USA customers.)  Rush orders for props and banners for international customers are NOT available.    \r\nYou must convo me PRIOR to purchase if you need a rush prop or banner order (for USA customers only please,)  as I may NOT be able to accommodate your request otherwise.  If you have already purchased and you need a rush order and have not contacted me prior to purchase via Etsy convo, then your shipping date will be as stated on your Etsy invoice and will ship on this date only, (or before if my schedule allows.)    Please do not leave messages in the note to seller at checkout that you need the order sooner than as stated, as I may NOT be able to accommodate your request or may even miss such requests during busy times.  YOUR SCHEDULED SHIP DATE IS STATED CLEARLY ON YOUR ETSY INVOICE  for props and banners- this will be the date your order ships unless you have contacted me PRIOR to purchase and a rush order has been agreed upon.  If you missed any of this information (which is stated clearly in each listing,) then please see below for information regarding cancellations and refunds.\r\n\r\n____________________________________________________\r\n\r\n** SKIN TONE FOR WOODEN DOLL WEDDING TOPPERS ***\r\n\r\n*** ALL CUSTOM WEDDING CAKE TOPPER DOLLS (NON THEMED) COME WITH NATURAL WOOD FACES (AS SHOWN IN MOST OF MY LISTINGS) - REGARDLESS OF SKIN TONE OR RACE STATED ON THE CUSTOMIZATION FORM - UNLESS A REQUEST FOR A &#39;PAINTED&#39; LIGHTER OR DARKER SKIN TONE IS REQUESTED - AND AN EXAMPLE OF WHICH IS SENT.**\r\n\r\nA NOTE REGARDING SKIN TONE FOR WEDDING TOPPERS:   for custom wedding toppers and peg doll orders- most of the doll sets shown in my shop have natural wood faces with just sealer, this works well for most peoples skin tones, for example White, Asian, light skinned Hispanic, Middle Eastern etc.  I usually only &#39;paint&#39; the faces upon request for either much darker skin tones or much lighter skin tones, for example, a very pale (pinkish white) couple such as Irish, may request a painted face for a pink/ white complexion, or for example, an African American couple will most likely request a painted face from anywhere from a light brown/ bronze tone, to a dark brown tone (examples can be seen in my shop listings)  \r\nPlease note that all dolls will be created with natural wood faces unless otherwise requested for a &#39;painted&#39; face for a lighter or darker skin tone.  For example if both bride and groom is white (or another race), and the bride states that she is pale, and the groom states that he is white but has a &#39;tan&#39;, or it is just stated as &#39;tan skin&#39; regardless of race, then both bride and groom will come the same with natural wood faces with sealer, unless you specifically request that the bride or groom be painted a &#39;tan&#39; color, or brown color, or dark brown color etc, and an example is sent of what exact tone of &#39;tan&#39; or brown etc you would like,  OTHERWISE NATURAL WOOD FACES WILL BE USED FOR BOTH BRIDE AND GROOM REGARDLESS OF RACE.  If you would like a skin tone other than the natural wood please let me know and what shade of tan or brown you would like the doll painted, please also send example(s), otherwise it will be natural wood faces for both/ all dolls regardless of race.  \r\nVERY IMPORTANT - Please also note that I may interpret  the color of the tan or brown skin to be lighter or darker than your wishes as this can be hard to tell from a photo, please bare this in mind when ordering, if you are particularly picking about this then I would recommend not ordering a &#39;painted&#39; skin tone.  I cannot accept returns on custom orders if you feel the skin tone color is not quite right,  as I cannot see you in person I can only go with my interpretation of the photo, please understand this, thank you kindly.\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________________\r\n\r\nARTISTIC CREATIONS AND RIGHTS.\r\n\r\nPlease note that although you are purchasing a custom wooden doll cake topper, my final artistic interpretation of the information that you have sent is the final outcome.   I do not sent photos prior to shipping for approval, you are purchasing my artistic interpretation of the information you have sent for your custom topper.  The customization from and the details/ photos that you have sent is the information that I use to base my work from, but the final outcome of the topper is my painted interpretation of that information.  When painting your wedding cake topper I may interoperate something differently than you see it or may even want it, for example if you send me a head shot pic of the groom with his head tilted to the side, his hair line may appear different to me (based on the photo sent) to what it actually is (front ways,)  so please send the most accurate photos possible, but please bare in mind that my artistic interpretation may vary from yours and what you see, since I can not actually see you in person.   Although I will follow your written information (the customization form) and the photos you have sent carefully, some interpretations may differ a little in comparison to the way you see things or even possibly what you may want, this is the nature of how custom orders go sometimes.    For example this can refer to placement of  hair lines, placement of hair on the head, facial hair etc, or even how the lines on a dress fall, or a suits details.   For example if you state on the customization form &quot;groom has facial hair&quot;  I will then ask you to send me a pic, if you sent a pic of the groom with a full beard, but you only want him with a goatee, then that could be conflicting information, if you don&#39;t actually state anywhere that you only want a goatee, then I have no way of knowing.    Remember you must state clearly what you want, I only have the form and some photo to work from, I can NOT see you in person.  Another issue could be colors, firstly colors don&#39;t always show the same on different computer monitors, also some colors are subjective to the person, for example if you sate &#39;fuschia&#39; for your hair flower, this can mean a great range of shades for &quot;fushia&quot;  just google &quot;fuschia&quot; and you see many different shades and types come up, these are the types of examples I am referring too.  I ask for the customization form to be competed and then I leave it up to the customer to state what and how much information is left, I will not harass you for info, so please leave as much detail as you can.  Please note that although I will try to work closely with you using the customization form and photos, some issues may still arise.  Please note that I reserve the right to have my artist representation of what I view as accurate and correct to the final wedding cake topper, as this is my creative artistic representation.  Please make sure that you understand this fully before placing an order for a custom doll wedding cake topper, thank you kindly, as refunds cannot be given on custom orders.\r\nI also reserve the right to use any photos I have taken of any items I have created.\r\n___________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n** Q.  WHAT IF I FORGOT TO SEND YOU PHOTOS OR DETAILS OR I LEFT IT TOO LATE, OR I SENT THEN VIA EMAIL INSTEAD OF ETSY CONVO?\r\n\r\n** A.  I will send you out a detailed convo (approx 3 to 5 days after purchase of a custom wedding cake topper.)  In that convo I will ask you for anything else that I may need from you such as photos etc to complete your order.  Please you must reply to this convo in a timely manner via ETSY CONVO ONLY please and NOT outside emails.  If I have not heard anything back from you via Etsy convo after I while, usually a few weeks,  then I may send a second convo to you.  If I still have not heard back from you then I will usually wait until approx 2 to 3 months to hear back from you, and if I don&#39;t hear back from you in that timeframe, then I will usually just create the topper set based on the written information that I have received only (the customization form) and then ship the topper set out.  If you try to send me photos at that stage it will be too late, you will receive your topper set created and based off the written information only.\r\nIf you have left me your wedding date and filled out the customization form, but do not answer to convos for requests for photos, (or you send them via email outside of Etsy, therefore I will NOT have received them,)  then I will aim to have your topper set created in time for your wedding date as stated at time of checkout, and will also base the creation off of the written details that you left only.  If you have left me a wedding date but no details then I will base the creation of the topper from the listing that you purchased (listing photo number 1.)\r\nIf you have left no wedding date and no details at all regarding your wedding topper set, then I will contact you as outlined above, and if I do not hear back from you, then I will either send you out a basic topper set based on the listing photo picture (number 1)  of the topper set that you purchased, or I may just put through to cancel the order.  PLEASE MAKE SURE TO SEND ME ALL PHOTOS AND DETAILS REGARDING YOUR CUSTOM TOPPER PLEASE ASAP - so that we do not run into any of the above issues.  Once again please send all details when requested via Etsy convo only please.  Remember if you send photos and details too late, it may be too late for me to accept them if I have already began work on your topper set based off the written information I have (or the listing photos example.)\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________________\r\n\r\nWHOLESALE\r\n\r\nAll wholesale orders are final. Returns or refunds for wholesale orders are not accepted. A Wholesale order cannot be cancelled once it has been placed and paid for.

This is to ensure that you receive it safely.  If you have items shipped to a work or hotel for example, then it is not delivered to you personally it is delivered to the work or hotel address.  The USPS is only responsible for delivering to the work or hotel address, and then the work or hotels &#39;internal&#39; mail system is responsible for getting it to you, and this is where things can go wrong.  It is also possible that a co-worker or hotel worker could damage your package, steal from your package etc, SO please have your items shipped to your HOME ADDRESS.

Please be advised I have no control over how long an international order can take to arrive, and I DO NOT guarantee international orders by a certain date or timeframe.  Early ordering is advised for all international orders, this is the responsibility of the customer to order early and allow enough shipping time to their destination with the understanding that a time sensitive order may perhaps not make it on time.\r\n\r\nALL USA BOUND PACKAGES ARE SENT WITH DELIVERY CONFIRMATION AND TRACKING - this is not available for international customers so please read full details below regarding international shipping.\r\n\r\nSome packages (USA bound) may require a signature union delivery (such as those sent with Express mail or expensive orders - this is at my discretion to ship this way - if you are requesting signature confirmation for a package that I would not usually ship that way, than an additional charge will be needed, please contact me PRIOR to purchase if needed (option for USA customers only.)\r\n____________________________________________________\r\n\r\n** Q . - WHEN WILL MY  PHOTO BOOTH PROP OR BANNER ORDER SHIP?\r\n\r\n**A. -  FOR PROPS AND BANNERS - YOUR SCHEDULED SHIP DATE WILL BE AS STATED ON YOUR ETSY INVOICE - top right by the address - I will ship on or before that date, please do not leave messages in the note to seller at checkout that you need the order sooner than as stated, as I may NOT be able to accommodate your request or may even miss such requests during busy times.

International orders vary, please see below for full international shipping details. Early ordering is recommended, if you need your prop or banner order earlier than as stated above, please convo me prior to purchase to see if a rush order is possible depending on my current work load, an upgraded shipping method may be needed for rush orders, please convo me PRIOR to purchase if in need of a rush order (available for USA customer only.)  \r\n\r\n____________________________________________________\r\n\r\n** Q.   HOW LONG WILL MY WOODEN DOLL WEDDING TOPPER TAKE TO CREATE - AND/OR WHEN WILL IT SHIP\r\n\r\n** A.  -  All wedding toppers are being processed by wedding date - creation timeframes Is subject to change for custom wedding wedding cake toppers.  Please check my schedule for toppers in my shop announcement PRIOR to purchase to see if I am still accepting orders for your wedding date and location.  \r\nI recommend all USA customers to try and order approx 2 to 3 months prior to the wedding date or date needed by.  I recommend all international customers to order at least 3 months prior to the wedding date or date needed by.  The earlier you can place the order the better as I may be fully booked for your wedding month if you wait to late.  Sometimes I have a few select &#39;rush&#39; slots available and these are an additional charge.  Please convo me prior to purchase if you are in need of a rush \r\norder.\r\nALL USA custom wedding topper order ship approx a week before the wedding date or date needed by (with the exception of rush orders.)  This means approx arrival date of your topper will be approx 4 days or so before your wedding date, or between 3 and 5 days before hand approx.  (Your order may be sent earlier if my schedule lightens.)\r\nALL INTERNATIONAL orders will ship approx 3 to 4 weeks before the wedding date or date needed by (which is well within the USPS recommend timeframe, (for the more difficult countries it may be sent earlier upon my discretion.  (Any and all orders may be sent earlier if my schedule lightens.)  International packages for wedding topper are NOT guaranteed by a certain date or timeframe due to international customs, (this means that the order is NOT guarantee to arrive in time for for wedding date,) but every effort will be made to send off in a timely manner as satiated above.\r\n__________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;\r\n\r\nPlease make sure to read below about International Shipping and the time frame that it takes, and about International customs.  International orders are not guaranteed by a certain delivery date, as this is impossible due to international customs, but every effort will be made to have wedding toppers make it in time, for wedding toppers I ship all International orders within the USPS guidelines for International shipping. Please see shop policies for full disclosure on international shipping.   \r\n\r\nProps and banners are made to order, the creation timeframe is as stated in the listing information, your scheduled ship date will be stated on your Etsy invoice (top right by the address.)  Your order will be shipped on or before this date.  When ordering props and/or banners please make sure to leave enough time for creation of the item plus shipping to your location.  Most international packages arrive in an approx 2 to 4 week timeframe, but it is possible for custom delays to occur.  Some countries take much longer for packages to arrive, these known countries are as stated below, (other countries not listed may also possibly be included in this list,)  in the case of these countries (or custom delays for all countries) then it is possible that shipping may even take a month or two, for up to a max of 3 months if custom delays arise.   I advise all international customers to order props and banners approx 2.5 to 3 months ahead of the date you need to receive them by for a timely delivery (not including creation time for the item) for safest bet, although for most customers an approx 2 to 4 weeks shipping timeframe for your package to arrive is the average norm.)\r\n\r\nThere is NO TRACKING for international orders - I ship with USPS first class air mail ONLY.  The USPS does not offer tracking numbers with this service so therefore I cannot offer this to my international customers, (so I cannot track an international packages on it&#39;s journey.)  An international package is assigned a Customs Declaration number which is proof of shipping, but does NOT track the package on it&#39;s journey at all, please bare this in mind when you order - Patience is needed if an international package is delayed or stuck in customs, if you do not have the time to wait for an international package to arrive then I advise you to please not order from this shop,  I have outlined very clearly how international shipping works and the timeframe that this may take, I have no control over international shipping, custom officials, and the timeframe that this may take.  Custom delays are a part of international shipping, if this upsets you then it is best not to order as delays may occur, this could mean that your package could possibly miss the day that you want/ need the item by, please understand that I cannot guarantee the arrival date of an international package, so if you cannot wait for the package to arrive or do not order in time (as stated above,) please do not order here as I have no way to track it, thank you kindly for understanding.\r\n\r\nIMPORT DUTY TAXES - Also pleased be advised that for international packages your country may also assess import duty/ taxes to your items you have purchased, (your package,)  this is the buyers responsibility to pay any taxes or duty fees associated with the package.   This is not a shipping charge, it is an import tax imposed by your country that you may have to pay to your country depending on the rules and regulations of your country, and the total purchase price of your package,  (I cannot mark a package as a gift as this is illegal, so please do not ask me.)   You must pay this import tax fee if your country applies this fee to your package if you wish to receive your package, you are paying the import duty/ tax to YOUR country for the import of the goods, this has nothing to do with the USA or shipping charges.   Seller will NOT pay import taxes for the customer,  as this in NOT a shipping charge, this is the buyers responsibility to pay any taxes that are applied by your county.    Please check with your local customs before placing an order if you do not wish to pay import or duty taxes to see if they apply for what you are ordering.  I do not know what the import duty taxes are for international countries and they may change at will, so please check first with your country BEFORE PURCHASE if this concerns you.   Returns and refunds will not be accepted due to a customer who refuses to pay import taxes  if your country decides to apply taxes to your package. \r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL countries that can take longer than usual for shipping include but are not limited to AUSTRALIA, and CANADA,  ASIAN countries, and BRAZIL.   These countries in particular BRAZIL and ASAIN countries can take ONE MONTH+ or longer sometimes for shipping, lease allow at least 2 to 3 MONTHS for shipping to these countries and order accordingly based on the above timeframes or timeframes stated in the listing.  Please allow approx 1 to 3 months for shipping to BRAZIL.   Other countries may also be included in this longer than usual timeframe.    \r\n_____________________________________________________\r\n\r\nWHOLESALE\r\n\r\nAll wholesale orders are final.

These cowboy hats are similar to Stetson style cowboy hats. They are made with quality in mind and are very sturdy, so you can rest assured that they will last a very long time. These are great for Nascar events, parties, tailgating, or just for decoration in the bar or game room. A 1&quot; elastic band allows this hat to fit most people from 6 1/2 to 7 5/8, but feel free to contact us if you need a special size. We can make these for most brands of beer that come in a 24 or 18 pack box of cans, so let us know if there is a certain brand you are looking for. It takes 3 case boxes to make 1 hat so please allow enough time for us to consume the beer. ;-) Hats will be shipped using FedEx ground. We work hard to make the best beer hats that you can buy. You will be very happy with your purchase.",
